### Solution 2:
Use CASE WHEN function, assign the S8 = 1 and others = 0, and assign iphone product = 1 and others as 0. 
The 1st having sum statement, filter out the buyer id that bought S8, the 2nd statement filter out the buyer_id didn't buy iphone. The intersector of two statement will be the buyer id bought s8 and not iphone
